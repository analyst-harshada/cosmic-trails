# Project Overview

Cosmic Trails
🚀 Inspiration
The vastness of space has always inspired humanity to dream big, explore the unknown, and push boundaries. "Cosmic Trails" was born from this spirit of exploration and curiosity. We wanted to create a 3D adventure game that allows players to immerse themselves in the wonder of space while solving puzzles, facing challenges, and experiencing a journey unlike any other.

This project combines our love for storytelling, game development, and technology into one thrilling experience.

🛠️ What We Learned
Through this project, we learned:

The fundamentals of 3D game development using Unity.
Optimizing 3D assets and physics for smooth gameplay.
Collaborating using GitHub for version control and teamwork.
Overcoming challenges like designing intuitive controls and balancing gameplay difficulty.
🏗️ How We Built It
Game Design:
We started with a detailed storyboard and sketches of the cosmic environment, challenges, and levels.
Development Environment:
Used Unity as the game engine for 3D development.
Leveraged Blender for modeling and animations.
Integrated C# scripts for gameplay mechanics and AI.
Collaboration:
Version control through GitHub.
